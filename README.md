# SD201 : Soccer Player Prediction

## Goal of the project
Establish an optimal number of football player profiles given their physical features and their in-match performances. It could be used as the tool during the transfer market to help recruiters find the football player matching with their expectations.

## Members
Hippolyte Giraud, Valerio Guerrini, LÃ©on Sillano, Romain Darous.

## Plan of the project
1. Data vizualisation,
2. Data preprocessing,
3. Finding correlation between features,
4. Distinguishing goalkeepers with a decision tree algorithm,
6. Performing K-Means clustering on the data to try to detect other player's positions,
7. Performing Random Forest classification on the data on the player's position,
8. Comparing performance of the models tried.

The whole process of the project is detailed and can be followed by reading the Jupyter notebook.
